Finally got simple job script to load by not giving it a name in the define().
Seems like requirejs in webworkers does not prepend any other pathing before calling importScripts()

Having trouble with a round trip to the JobStarted and back to the thread.

Putting down for a bit.

Later got code executing got our first test passing and then another one...
Trying to pony up a test with XHR...

supposedly anyone can use these endpoints for testing.

[JSON test](http://www.jsontest.com/)

WE keep inserting base to the url to the script is correct...find a not so obvious method to reolve this better...maybe requirejs.toUrl()
