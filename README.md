+ [WebWorkers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Worker)


## Abstract

A web worker that runs small scripts with a certain interface and wraps the work in a promise.

The idea would be to figure out this mechanism and how to run tests in it as well then publish it.

So for some reason they named threads web workers in the browser so I have named this package webjobs.


## Tasks

+ [ ] Get basic tests running with client code running webworkers.


## Status

6/09/2018

Got tests running...got requirejs laoding in test not in regular browser...
upon configure of requirejs...we cannot request the job maybe we need base/


Late ... the requirejs is configured and we supposdely succeed in loading Job script but it is NOT being called.  we cannot instantiate...

SO if we give the full path to the job script the importScripts() call works and we get called back but the object is null because the define does not match the url...

Very difficult problem to solve...
