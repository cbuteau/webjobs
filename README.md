+ [WebWorkers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Worker)


## Abstract

A web worker that runs small scripts with a certain interface and wraps the work in a promise.

The idea would be to figure out this mechanism and how to run tests in it as well then publish it.

So for some reason they named threads web workers in the browser so I have named this package webjobs.


## Tasks

+ [ ] Get basic tests running with client code running webworkers.
